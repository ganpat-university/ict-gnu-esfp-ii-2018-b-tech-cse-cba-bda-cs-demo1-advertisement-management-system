Project-14 Advertisement Management System.
The idea is to bring advertisement simpler and more manageable. Implement a class AMS and include variables such as add_id,add_type(emotional/humorous/musical/educatio nal),props_used,add_expense, eye_balls_collected, no_of_times_played,add_duration,add_shooting_places ,No_of_actors. Implement class Director having variables such as D_id,D_name, D_contact,D_Charge. Now implement a class called company and store variables such as Co_id,Co_contact, Co_Name, Co_establishment_year. Now make database for 5 adds,5 directors, 5 companies. Ask for advertisement type and display suitable director, and the company that may do the add.
